# 🔧 Hugging Face API Fix

## ❌ **The Problem**
Your app was configured for **Replicate API** but you have a **Hugging Face API key**. That's why it wasn't working!

## ✅ **The Fix**
I've updated your `musicgen-server.js` to use Hugging Face API instead of Replicate.

## 🚀 **Quick Setup**

### 1. **Set Your API Key**
```bash
export HUGGING_FACE_API_KEY="hf_your_actual_token_here"
```

### 2. **Test Your API Key**
```bash
node test-huggingface.js
```

You should see:
```
✅ SUCCESS! Generated XXXX bytes of audio
🎵 Your Hugging Face API key is working!
```

### 3. **Start Your Server**
```bash
node musicgen-server.js
```

You should see:
```
🔑 Hugging Face API Key configured: Yes
```

### 4. **Test Your App**
- Go to `https://localhost:3000/try-it-now.html`
- Record some audio
- Select an instrument
- You should get **real AI-generated music**!

## 🎵 **What Changed**

### Before (Replicate):
- Complex polling system
- Required Replicate API key
- More expensive

### After (Hugging Face):
- Simple direct API call
- Uses your existing Hugging Face key
- Free tier available

## 🔍 **Troubleshooting**

### If you get "API key not configured":
1. Make sure you set the environment variable
2. Restart your server after setting it
3. Check the server logs

### If you get rate limit errors:
- Hugging Face free tier has limits
- Wait a few minutes and try again
- Consider upgrading to paid plan

### If you get model loading errors:
- The model might be loading
- Wait 2-3 minutes and try again
- This is normal for free tier

## 🎉 **You're All Set!**

Your app should now work with real MusicGen AI generation using your Hugging Face API key!
